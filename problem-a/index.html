     <!-- Paragraph about the character -->
     <p>
         For this assignment, I chose to create a website for Prince Zuko, 
         a character from <cite><a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Zuko">Avatar: the Last Airbender</a></cite>, a Nickelodeon show that 
         premiered in 2005. I decided to write Prince Zuko as he has a very interesting 
         character arc and development throughout the three seasons of the show. 
         Initially, Zuko starts out as a villain and the show’s main antagonist. 
         He is on a mission to capture the Avatar, the show’s protagonist, who is 
         destined to save the world from the fire nation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout the course of the show, the viewer is able to watch Zuko struggle, 
        grow, and develop into a very likable character. He shifts from being the main 
        villain searching to regain his “honor”, to a good guy who befriends the Avatar 
        and aiding him in his mission of saving the world.  
    </p>

    <p>   
        Avatar: the Last Airbender is one of my favorite shows of all time and I 
        believe Prince Zuko greatly contributed to the success of the show.
    </p>
